## 👤 About me

I worked as a full-stack software engineer for over 10 years. In this process, I took end-to-end responsibility of:

- front-end and back-end,
- architectural design,
- DevOps (container management, production deployments, continuous integration),
- analysis of requirements from customers.

I developed in many various domains (banking, payment systems, e-commerce, airports...) and handled problems faced in long-term legacy projects. Due to my first-hand observations, I solved scalability and maintainability problems in the projects I rewrote by taking the advantage of cutting-edge technologies such as micro-services.

With my wide-range experience, I solved complex problems following best-practices of architectural design patterns and I adopt new working environments and technologies efficiently.

- Team player with outstanding communication skills.
- Implements Domain-Driven-Design.
- Clean Coding and Object-Oriented principles.
